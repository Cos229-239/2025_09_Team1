# WilderCards

## Description
This mobile application allows users to take or upload a photo of an animal and generates a “trading card” styled profile for the detected species. Users can log in using Firebase Authentication, and the app fetches species information from a backend database. The animal recognition is powered by a Python-based image recognition model. The generated cards include the animal’s image, name, description, and stats, inspired by the Pokémon trading card style.
